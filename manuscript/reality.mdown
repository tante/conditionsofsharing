# Reality

In 2009 the government of Sweden was trialling the 3 founders of the file-sharing site "The Pirate Bay". At some point in the hearings Peter Sunde was asked about the beginnings of the collaboration by the judge: "*When was the first time you met IRL?*[^irl]" Sunde replied: "*We donâ€™t use the expression IRL. We say AFK- Away From Keyboard. We think that the internet is for real.*"
