# Introduction

As I am writing this, the Internet is not a new thing, it has existed since 1982. Now I could pretend that I know the birth date of the Internet by heart, that this network that permeates almost every aspect of my everyday life has become so important to me that I celebrate its coming into this world every year with cake and a party. But that would be dishonest. 

I paused writing to look up the exact fact. There, it's out. I went to Wikipedia[^wiki1] to get the date.
