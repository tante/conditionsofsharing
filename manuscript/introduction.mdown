# Introduction

As I am writing this, the Internet is not a new thing, it has existed since 1982. But even after over 30 years William Gibson's quote still rings true:

> The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed.

Where some people have integrated the Internet as deeply into their lives as their ability to read or speak or sing, others have - for a plethora of different but mostly economic reasons - not even proper regular access to it. 

Uneven distribution of new technologies is really nothing new. After leaving their inventor's lab, many technologies tend to spread to the hands of certain elites: New technologies tend to be costly to build and maintain, especially if you yourself do not have all the skills necessary. So you end up having to pay some technician or other sort of expert as a maintainer, you need to obtain the required consumable supplies and last but certainly not least you have to have the time and leisure to even develop an interest into some technology the mainstream has not taken note of.  

Now I could pretend that I know the birth date of the Internet by heart, that this network that permeates almost every aspect of my everyday life has become so important to me that I celebrate its coming into this world every year with cake and a party. But that would be dishonest. 

I paused writing to look up the exact fact. There, it's out. I went to Wikipedia[^wiki1] to get the date, quickly scanned the full page[^wikiInternet] for the little tidbit of information I needed at that moment. And I will probably have forgotten it by tomorrow morning leaving me just with a lingering feeling of an idea of how old the Internet is.

But I am telling you those rather trivial events not as an act of self-deprecation[^wikideprecation], not to try to get on your good side or to get you to sympathise with me - far from that actually. I am being very open with you because I respect you too much to waste your time.

This book is an approach to explain a few aspects of the Internet and the way we live in it. A collection of a web of thoughts that I have been developing during the last few years.

In 2011 I got involved with a German group of people calling themselves the "datenschutzkritische Spackeria"[^spackeria]



I won't lie to you, you might not like every idea I present and elaborate here. I will challenge a few of the so-called *truths* that we as a society have made ourselves comfortable with, will tell you that many of the things that certain authorities, activists or civil rights proponents have promised you really are impossible at best and a lie at worst.

[^spackeria]: a rough english translation would be "data-protection criticizing Spackeria" with "Spackeria" being a play on the word "Spacko" meaning something like idiot
